      <h2>Welcome to Ouchi Gohan</h2>
      <p>
        In Japanese, “Ouchi Gohan” means “home-cooked meal.” At Ouchi Gohan, we believe 
        that even the simplest dishes can bring warmth, joy, and connection to the table. 
        You don’t need to be an expert chef or have access to rare ingredients to enjoy 
        Japanese meals. What truly matters is the feeling behind the food—cooking slowly, 
        sharing joy with loved ones, and finding comfort in each bite.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you are a student, a busy parent, or just someone who wants to make good 
        meals at home, our recipes are designed to be simple and comforting. Many of them 
        use ingredients you can find at local grocery stores, and most dishes can be 
        prepared in under 30 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Explore easy recipes, learn simple techniques, and enjoy stories connected to 
        everyday Japanese cooking. Whether you’re far from Japan or discovering these 
        dishes for the first time, this space will help you bring honest, heartfelt
