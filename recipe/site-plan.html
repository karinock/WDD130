        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
The Home page features a full-width header with the Ouchi Gohan logo on the left and navigation links on the right. A large hero banner introduces the site theme with the title “Ouchi Gohan (おうちごはん)” and a short subtitle. Below the hero, a welcome section explains the meaning and warmth of Japanese home-style cooking. The next section includes three feature boxes—Easy Recipes, Learn the Basics, and Cook with Heart—each with an image and label, linking users to deeper content. A final introductory message further explains the spirit of Japanese home kitchens. The page uses consistent fonts, full-width sections, and generous whitespace, ending with a complete footer containing links and social icons.      </p>
      <img src="images/homewireframe.png" alt="home page wireframe">

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>         
The Recipes page keeps the same header and navigation for consistency. A medium hero banner introduces the page with the title “Recipes | Taste of Home.” The main section displays a grid of recipe cards, each containing an image, dish name in Japanese and English, and a short description. Below the grid, a two-column section pairs a text block about the meaning behind home cooking with a vertical image. This page removes category blocks to preserve a full-width footer, maintaining strong visual balance. Typography, spacing, and layout follow the design patterns of the home page to create a cohesive experience.      </p>
      <img src="images/recipeswireframe.png" alt="page 2 wireframe">

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>         
The Essentials page starts with the shared header, followed by a wide hero banner titled “Kitchen Essentials | Get Started.” The first section displays three ingredient boxes—soy sauce, miso, and mirin—arranged in a clean three-column layout with simple icons or placeholders. Below this, a two-column layout presents essential kitchen tools, with an image of a rice cooker on the left and a bullet list of tools on the right. A full-width text section explains beginner techniques such as measuring rice, making dashi, and storing ingredients. The page ends with a callout box encouraging users to start their cooking journey and a consistent full-width footer.      </p>
