      Welcome to Ouchi Gohan (おうちごはん), a place where cooking feels like home. In Japanese, Ouchi Gohan means “home-cooked meal,” and this website is all about sharing the warmth, simplicity, and happiness that come from preparing everyday food with care. You do not need to be an expert chef or have access to rare ingredients to enjoy Japanese meals. What truly matters is the feeling behind the food — cooking slowly, sharing joy with loved ones, and finding comfort in each bite.</p>
      <p>
      Whether you are a student, a busy parent, or just someone who wants to make good meals at home, our recipes are designed to be simple and comforting. Many of them use ingredients you can find at local grocery stores, and most dishes can be prepared in under 30 minutes.        </p>
      <p>
      We invite you to explore easy recipes, learn simple techniques, and enjoy stories connected to everyday Japanese cooking. Whether you are far from Japan or discovering these dishes for the first time, this space will help you bring honest, heartfelt flavors into your kitchen. Let us make cooking enjoyable, calm, and meaningful, one home-style meal at a time.</p>

      <h3>Taste of Home</h3>
      <p>
      Welcome to the Recipes section, the heart of Ouchi Gohan. Here, you will find a collection of easy Japanese dishes created for real-life cooking. Whether you're craving something warm like miso soup, want a quick meal like onigiri, or are preparing dinner for friends and family such as teriyaki chicken or Japanese curry rice, you will find recipes that are simple, budget-friendly, and full of flavor.</p>
      <p>
      Each recipe includes step-by-step instructions, estimated cooking time, ingredients you can find in most supermarkets, and helpful notes to prevent common beginner mistakes. Many dishes also come with personal tips or mini stories that explain when the meal is typically enjoyed in Japan and how you can customize it to match your taste.</p>
      <p>
      We focus on cozy “everyday meals”, the kind that remind you of home, quiet evenings, or comforting lunches packed with thoughtfulness. These recipes are ideal if you're learning to cook, living away from home, or simply wanting to reconnect with familiar flavors.</p>

      <h3>Kitchen Basics & Ingredients</h3>
      <p>Before you start your cooking journey, let us get your kitchen ready. This page introduces the key ingredients and tools used in daily Japanese meals, items that may seem simple but make all the difference in flavor.</p>
      <p>The most important ingredients include soy sauce, which adds saltiness and depth; miso, commonly used in soups and marinades; and mirin, a slightly sweet cooking rice wine that adds balance to savory dishes. You will also learn about dashi, a light broth that is the base of many traditional recipes and gives Japanese food its signature savory taste.</p>
      <p>Even without a full Japanese kitchen, you can cook most dishes using just a rice cooker, a sharp knife, a basic pot or pan, and a cutting board. We will walk you through how to measure rice correctly, how to store ingredients to keep them fresh longer, and how to build flavor even with simple methods.</p>
      <p>This guide is made for beginners. No pressure, no perfection. With just a few essentials and a little curiosity, anyone can start preparing comforting Japanese meals at home. Take it one small step at a time, and enjoy the journey.</p>

      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
The Home page features a full-width header with the Ouchi Gohan logo on the left and navigation links on the right. A large hero banner introduces the site theme with the title “Ouchi Gohan (おうちごはん)” and a short subtitle. Below the hero, a welcome section explains the meaning and warmth of Japanese home-style cooking. The next section includes three feature boxes—Easy Recipes, Learn the Basics, and Cook with Heart—each with an image and label, linking users to deeper content. A final introductory message further explains the spirit of Japanese home kitchens. The page uses consistent fonts, full-width sections, and generous whitespace, ending with a complete footer containing links and social icons.      </p>
      <img src="images/homewireframe.png" alt="home page wireframe">

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>         
The Recipes page keeps the same header and navigation for consistency. A medium hero banner introduces the page with the title “Recipes | Taste of Home.” The main section displays a grid of recipe cards, each containing an image, dish name in Japanese and English, and a short description. Below the grid, a two-column section pairs a text block about the meaning behind home cooking with a vertical image. This page removes category blocks to preserve a full-width footer, maintaining strong visual balance. Typography, spacing, and layout follow the design patterns of the home page to create a cohesive experience.      </p>
      <img src="images/recipeswireframe.png" alt="page 2 wireframe">

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>         
The Essentials page starts with the shared header, followed by a wide hero banner titled “Kitchen Essentials | Get Started.” The first section displays three ingredient boxes—soy sauce, miso, and mirin—arranged in a clean three-column layout with simple icons or placeholders. Below this, a two-column layout presents essential kitchen tools, with an image of a rice cooker on the left and a bullet list of tools on the right. A full-width text section explains beginner techniques such as measuring rice, making dashi, and storing ingredients. The page ends with a callout box encouraging users to start their cooking journey and a consistent full-width footer.      </p>
