        <h2>Every Recipe Has a Memory</h2>
        <p>
          Many Japanese home-style dishes are connected to simple, everyday moments—school 
          lunches, family gatherings, or quiet dinners at home. In this recipe collection, 
          we focus on meals that feel familiar and comforting rather than complicated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each recipe includes step-by-step instructions, estimated cooking time, and ideas 
          for substitutions when you cannot find certain ingredients. These tips are meant 
          to help you relax in the kitchen and enjoy the process instead of worrying about 
          perfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Try one recipe at a time, taste as you go, and make small changes to match your 
          own preferences. The goal is to create food that tastes like home to you.
